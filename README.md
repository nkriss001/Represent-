### PROG02: Represent!
#### Designed by Nicholas Kriss
Represent! is a political app designed to help inform potential voters about their local congressional representatives. Users can input their ZIP code, or use their phone's current location, and the app will present a list of senators and representatives for their area. In addition to basic information like their name and political affiliation, the app presents the user with links to the representative's website and, when available, their contact page. The user can also get information about what congressional committees the representative serves on and what recent bills they have sponsored. Finally, the app allows the user to view congressional information for any random ZIP code in the United States. This app uses Google Location to get the user's current location, Geocodio to convert location data into congressional districts, and the ProPublica Congress API to get information about the individual representatives.

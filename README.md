### PROG02: Represent!
#### Designed by Nicholas Kriss
Represent! is an application designed to help inform potential voters about their local congressional representatives. The user can enter their ZIP code, or have the app determine their current location, and the app will display a list of Senators and Representatives for that area. In addition to basic information like the representative's political party, the app tells the user on what committees the representative is currently serving and what bills they have recently sponsored. The app also, when available, provides the user with links to the representative's official website and contact page. An additional feature is that the user can see the congressional information for a randomly generated ZIP code. This app was made possible by the Google Location feature of the Android phone, Geocodio to convert location data into congressional districts, and ProPublica to obtain information about the representatives.
